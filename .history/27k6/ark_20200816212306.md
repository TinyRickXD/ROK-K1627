## Basic Guide for every player

- Make sure you're out of <b>WAR FRENZY</b> before osiris. [IMPORTANT]
- Score at least 10 thousand points for max rewards. [IMPORTANT]
- Runes and kingdom titles for work during osiris.
- Always make reinforcement rallies and garrisons your priority instead of field fights.
- Never swarm a building alone wait for rally to hit first.
- Good practice is to keep 3 strong marches for field battles, Use 2 marches to reinforce rallies and garrison.
- Never reinforce rally and garrison from far away. Make your bring your march near by and then reinforce.
- You can swarm pretty much any rally except Attilla/Takeda. Never ever swarm Attilla/Takeda unless you wish to fill hospital very early.
