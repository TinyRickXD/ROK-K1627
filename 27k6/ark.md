## Basic Guide for every player

- Make sure you're out of <b>`WAR FRENZY`</b> before osiris. `[MOST IMPORTANT]`
- Score at least `10 thousand` points to claim max individual rewards. [IMPORTANT]
- Select your best `city skin` before osiris. [IMPORTANT]
- Make sure your marches are equipped with best available `equipments` before osiris. [IMPORTANT]
- Make sure you activate your `boosts` & set your marches before osiris. [IMPORTANT]
- `Runes` and `kingdom titles` does not work during osiris.
- Never `swarm` a building alone wait for rally to hit first.
- Always make sure to prioritize reinforcing `rallies` and `garrisons` instead of `field battles`.
- Good practice is to keep 3-4 strong marches for `field battles`, Use 1-2 marches to reinforce rallies and garrison.
- Never reinforce rally and garrison from `far away`. Bring your march `near` by and then reinforce.
- You can swarm pretty much any rally except `Attilla/Takeda`. Never ever `swarm` Attilla/Takeda unless you wish to `fill hospital` very early.
